    <ul>
        <li>Static</li>
        <li>Dynamic</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Types of Web Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Server</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Hosts the resources and handle the client requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Web Client</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The ones accessing or utilizing the resources. Done on browsers or applications.</li>

<h1>History of the World Wide Web</h1>
    <!-- Insert image of Tim Berners-Lee -->
    <h2>Who is Tim Berners-Lee?</h2>
    <p>Tim Berners-Lee is the father of the modern World Wide Web. The World Wide Web started a tool that Tim Berners-Lee wanted to help scientists easily share their data. At that point, hypertext and the internet already existed. Tim Berners-Lee just thought of another way to utilize it.</p>
    
    <h2>The World Wide Web Development Timeline</h2>
    <h3>1989</h3>
    <p>The World Wide proposal was created by Tim Berners-Lee. His proposal included the three WWW main technologies: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>URL</li>
        <li>HTTP</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>1991</h3>
    <p>Tim Berners-Lee created the first website which was hosted by CERN in Switzerland where he used to work.</p>
    
    <h3>1992</h3>
    <p>The first web server was set up in America and there were only 10 known web servers at this point in time.</p>
    
    <h3>1993</h3>
    <p>The world wide web finally became open source. CERN allowed anyone to use the web protocols and code for free. People were able to create their own websites for their businesses. The known web servers at this point had a count of 50.</p>
    
    <h4>1994</h4>
    <p>The World Wide Web became accessible at people's own homes. Telecommunications providers gave that access. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was also founded by Tim Berners-Lee which is an organization that makes sure that the World Wide Web keeps on improving.</p>

<h1>WWW vs the Internet</h1>
    <p>People often get confused and think the World Wide Web and the Internet are the same thing. Well, they're not. The Internet is merely the infrastructure or network being utilized by the World Wide Web.</p>
    
<h1>The Internet</h1>
    <h2>Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hosts</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The end devices or the devices utilized by both clients and servers.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Media</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The wires or the medium that data travels or transmitted on.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Protocols</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Protocols are standards for communication, connections and data transfer in a network.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
<h1>How does the Web Work?</h1>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Uniform Resource Locator</li>
        <li>It is a unique identifier indicating the location of a resource in the web.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>IP</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Internet Protocol</li>
        <li>Used by hosts and the Domain name server (DNS) would be the one giving out IP addresses to host names.</li>
    </ul>
