SERVER SIDE WEB SCRIPTING 

	Java Servlets
			Java objects that are intended to play the role of server components in client-server communications.
			Handles client request by generating responses to such reequest 
			part of the Java EE specification (see Java Servlet API for more details)
			Hosted in a servelet container that provides the environment in which the servlet runs, as well as contains the servelet cycle. 

		Servelet Lifecycle:
			Instantiation 
				Construction call
				Creates an instance of the servelet to service client request.
				Invoke implicity by the servelet container when the servlet is called upon to service
			Request Handling 
				Service() method
				Invoke for each client request
				Multiple client requests are typically handled by a single multi-threaded servlet instant thus, care must be exercised to ensure the code being run by the servlet is threaded safe.
			Destruction

	HTTP Servlet 
		Java Servlet used to handle HTTP Request and generate HTTP response 
		Hosted in a web container; which is a component in a Java Application Server (e.g. Apache Tomcat, Red Hat, JBoss/wildfly, Oracle Glassfish, IBM Websphere, etc ...)
		The service() method call is routed to a doxxx() ca;;, depending on the HTTP request method e.g. doSet(), doPost(), doHead(), doPut(), doDelete(), etc...
		The doxxx() methods are passed two arguments:
			HTTP Servelet Request
				Object representation of the HTTP request sent by the client
			HTTP servlet Response 
				Object representation of the HTTP response generated by the servlet and sent book to requesting client.
