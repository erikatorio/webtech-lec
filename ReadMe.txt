Requirements for accessing website since there is an included php file:
1. Activate or install server with PHP for the search.php file to work. (i.e MAMP or XAMP or WAMP).
2. Change server's root directory to where the "website" directory is located.
3. Access website in a browser through the url localhost:8080/ or localhost if the port is 80.

Note: The search bar in the home page are set to link the world wide web topic with the query "www", the html topic with
"html", and the http topic with "http". Any other query would link back to the home page. Although, it is case insensitive. 
The search functionality is set for further improvement.
